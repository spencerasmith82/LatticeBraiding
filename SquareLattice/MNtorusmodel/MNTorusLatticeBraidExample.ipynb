A natural questions to ask, is whether we can find a higher TEPO braid in the $4x4$ regime than this one?  This is much harder to systematically study, since for the 4x4 torus lattice, a complete enumeration of every braid operator is going to be too unwieldly (there are 272 tilings (i.e. perfect matchings), and for each of these, each pairing could be CCW or CW, which gives  $2^8=256$  possibilities for each matching, or 69632 possible operators).  This is not to mention the combinatorics we get from adding in braid length."
